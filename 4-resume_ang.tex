\mychapter{0}{Abstract}
The present document constitutes the summary of the work carried out during my end-of-studies internship at \textbf{SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE AFRICAN BUSINESS SERVICES}. My mission was to contribute to the development of new features for the \textbf{SG CONNECT} application, which offers high-value mobile and web banking functionalities for Société Générale's clients in the AFS region.\\

As a front-end developer, I joined the Bank Up team and participated in all the necessary steps for the development and deployment of these new features.\\

The \textbf{SG CONNECT} application is a web and mobile application that allows Société Générale's clients to check their account balance and transaction history in real-time, make national transfers between accounts or to beneficiaries, perform cardless withdrawals, transfer money to the YUP wallet, set up alerts, find branches or ATMs, download their bank statement, and check currency exchange rates.\\

The project implementation steps included setting up a monorepo architecture to facilitate source code management, adding new features based on provided technical specifications, and enhancing the user experience.\\

The Agile Scrum methodology was adopted to successfully carry out this project, with iterations every two weeks, development sprints, and regular code reviews to ensure code quality. Additionally, wireframe design and User Story development were carried out. We also implemented unit tests and integration tests to ensure the proper functioning of the application. The development tools used included ReactJS, React Native, Nginx, Cypress, Jira, and Git.
